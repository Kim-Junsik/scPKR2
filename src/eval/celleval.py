"""Export predictions in the form cell-eval 0.5.42 consumes.

cell-eval lives in a separate Python 3.11 environment (.env-celleval) because it
pulls in a dependency set that conflicts with this project's. So the work is split
in two: this module runs inside the training environment and writes two .h5ad
files, and scripts/run_celleval.py then invokes the other interpreter on them.

Protocol note. The handoff spec's external comparison evaluates on all 19,264
genes, but this model predicts the 3,074-gene modelled space, so the export is
that space. Numbers are therefore comparable BETWEEN our runs, and comparable to
scDFM only after scDFM is re-scored on the same gene set - they are not directly
comparable to the published table.
