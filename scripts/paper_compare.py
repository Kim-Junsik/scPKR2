"""The published tables, transcribed, with this model's row added.

The numbers for the other models are TRANSCRIBED FROM THE PAPERS' OWN TABLES and are
not reproducible from this repository - nothing here can recompute them. They live in
source so that a table can be redrawn without the screenshots, which is how they were
lost once already.

scPKR's row is v2's, measured and frozen at 20a24c3: scripts/paper_table.py over its
runs, the sample gate with the gamma realisation at 4,096 cells, so its L2 and the
five cell-eval columns beside it come from one prediction rather than two. The mean
that model states - the soft gate, which is what an L2 between means asks for - is
carried separately in SOFT_L2 and is the lower of the two everywhere.

IT IS A COMPARISON ROW HERE, NOT AN "ours". This repository's model has to beat it,
and it is listed beside the published models for that reason. A row for this
repository is added once there is something measured to put in it.
